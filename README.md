# README

This repository contains files and templates for IETF working group chairs and participants to use in Github repositories being used for IETF work.

[LICENSE.md](https://github.com/ietf/repo-files/blob/master/LICENSE.md) - Official boilerplate text to be included in all affected repositories, per https://trustee.ietf.org/license-for-open-source-repositories.html. Note that this text is often incorporated into a longer CONTRIBUTING.md file, but can also be provided stand-alone.

[CONTRIBUTING-i-d-template.md](https://github.com/ietf/repo-files/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING-i-d-template.md) - The CONTRIBUTING.md template file that is included in a commonly used [template](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template) for configuring a new repository for working on an Internet-Draft. This file embeds the official boilerplate mentioned above and includes additional useful information for participants to be aware of. This template is in common use now.

[contributing-samples](https://github.com/ietf/repo-files/tree/master/contributing-samples) - Samples of different CONTRIBUTING.md files currently in use. Note that several WGs are re-using highly similar versions (i.e., CORE, ACME, TLS).

[note-well.html]() - The text of the IETF note well, if you should need it.
